## HowTo: Using the Software with the Hardware (Hand Gesture LED Control)

This section explains how to set up the hardware and run the software so that hand gestures detected by a camera control LEDs connected to an Arduino.

---

### Hardware Requirements

* Arduino Nano / Uno (any board with USB serial support)
* 5 LEDs
* 5 current-limiting resistors (220Ω–330Ω)
* Breadboard and jumper wires
* USB cable
* PC with a webcam

---

### Hardware Setup

1. Connect each LED **in series with a resistor**.
2. Connect the LED pins to the Arduino as follows:

| Finger | Arduino Pin |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Thumb  | D8          |
| Index  | D9          |
| Middle | D10         |
| Ring   | D11         |
| Pinky  | D12         |

3. Connect all LED cathodes (short legs) to **GND**.
4. Power the Arduino using the USB cable.

> ⚠️ Do not power the circuit externally while connected via USB.

### Firmware Installation (Arduino)

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Paste the provided Arduino code into a new sketch.
3. Select:

   * **Board:** Your Arduino model
   * **Port:** Correct COM port
4. Upload the code to the Arduino.
5. Leave the Arduino connected to the computer.

The Arduino listens for **5 bytes over Serial**, each representing a finger (1 = LED ON, 0 = LED OFF).

### Software Setup (PC / VS Code)

1. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyserial
```

2. Open the Python script in VS Code.
3. Update the serial port if needed:

```python
arduino = serial.Serial(port='COM3', baudrate=9600, timeout=1)
```

(Replace `COM3` with your system’s port.)

4. Ensure a webcam is connected.

### Running the Full System

1. Plug in the Arduino and confirm the firmware is uploaded.
2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python python.py
```

3. A webcam window will open showing hand tracking.
4. Raise or lower fingers in front of the camera.
5. Each detected finger turns its corresponding LED **ON or OFF** in real time.

| Gesture     | LED Response |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Finger up   | LED ON       |
| Finger down | LED OFF      |

---

### How the System Works

1. **MediaPipe** detects hand landmarks from the webcam feed.
2. Each finger is classified as **up (1)** or **down (0)**.
3. A list of 5 values is sent to the Arduino via Serial.
4. The Arduino sets each LED state accordingly.

### Stopping the Program

* Press **ESC** to close the webcam window.
* The serial connection will close automatically.
