# AI Hardware Project Proposal Template

## 1. Project Title
Name of the Team
Circuit Inteligence

List of students in the team
Yasir Babiker and Fares Elsherbiny

Provide a clear and concise title for your project. 
Smart LED Control Using Real-Time Hand Detection
## 2. Platform Selection
Embedded System Platform – Arduino

Justification:

The Arduino platform is chosen because it provides an easy and efficient way to control LEDs and interface with sensors for hand gesture detection. Its low latency and real-time processing make it ideal for responsive hardware control. Arduino’s open-source libraries, affordability, and strong community support also make it perfect for building a simple yet effective hand gesture-controlled LED system.

## 3. Problem Definition
The main problem this project addresses is creating an efficient and responsive system that can recognize hand gestures and control LEDs in real time using low-power embedded hardware. Traditional gesture recognition systems often rely on high-performance computers or cloud processing, which increases latency and power consumption.

This project focuses on running gesture detection locally on an Arduino-based platform, minimizing delay between gesture input and LED response. The relevance to AI hardware lies in optimizing limited computational resources to achieve real-time interaction — improving efficiency, reducing latency, and demonstrating how AI concepts can be implemented on small, scalable embedded systems.
